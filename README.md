# simple_quiz
This code implements a simple quiz game in Python.

The Question class is defined to represent a question object. Each question has a prompt, a list of options, and the correct option number.

The run_quiz function takes a list of Question objects as input. It iterates over each question, displays the prompt and options to the user, and asks for their answer. If the answer is correct, the score is incremented. At the end of the quiz, the user is shown their score.

Several sample questions are defined using the Question class. Additional questions can be added by creating more instances of the Question class and appending them to the questions list.

Finally, the quiz is run by calling the run_quiz function with the questions list as an argument.

Overall, this code allows users to take a quiz by answering multiple-choice questions and provides them with a score at the end.
